## Overview

F<sup>3</sup> architecture is designed specifically for events. F<sup>3</sup> is a predictive representation of events. It is a statistic of past events sufficient to predict future events. We prove that such a representation retains information about the structure and motion in the scene. F<sup>3</sup> achieves low-latency computation by exploiting the sparsity of event data using a multi-resolution hash encoder and permutation-invariant architecture. Our implementation can compute F<sup>3</sup> at 120 Hz and 440 Hz at HD and VGA resolutions, respectively, and can predict different downstream tasks at 25-75 Hz at HD resolution. These HD inference rates are roughly 2-5 times faster than the current state-of-the-art event-based methods. Please refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25146) for more details.

## Quickstart

### Installation

```bash
conda create -n f3 python=3.11
conda activate f3
```

Install F<sup>3</sup> locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:grasp-lyrl/fast-feature-fields.git
cd fast-feature-fields
pip install -e .
```

### Inference using pretrained F<sup>3</sup>

To get you up and running quickly, we can download a small sequence from M3ED and run some inference tasks on it.

### Training an F<sup>3</sup>

Please refer to `data/README.md` for detailed instructions on setting up the datasets. This is only important if you want to train F<sup>3</sup> models on the M3ED, DSEC or MVSEC datasets.

```bash
accelerate launch --config_file confs/accelerate_confs/2GPU.yml main.py\
                  --conf confs/ff/trainoptions/patchff_fullcardaym3ed_small_20ms.yml\
                  --compile
```
